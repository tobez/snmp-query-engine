# NAME

snmp-query-engine - multiplexing SNMP query engine

# VERSION

This document describes snmp-query-engine version 2023053100.

# SYNOPSIS

snmp-query-engine

# DESCRIPTION

The `snmp-query-engine` daemon accepts multiple
client connections and performs SNMP queries
towards multiple destinations on behalf of its clients,
taking care of multiplexing and throttling the requests.
This allows querying large number of devices for
large amounts of SNMP information quickly,
while controlling the load on the devices
induced by multiple SNMP queries.

Clients communicate with the `snmp-query-engine` 
daemon via TCP.  Both requests and responses
are encoded using MessagePack format,
http://msgpack.org/.

# OPTIONS

-h
:   produce usage text and quit

-p **prt**
:   listen on port **prt** instead of default **7667**

-q
:   quiet operation

# REQUESTS

All requests are arrays of at least two elements.

parameter 0
:   The first element must be a request type
    represented by a small positive integer:
    1 (**SETOPT**), 2 (**GETOPT**), 3 (**INFO**), 4 (**GET**), 5 (**GETTABLE**), 6 (**DEST INFO**).

parameter 1
:   The second element must be a **request id**,
    represented by a positive integer.
    It is a good idea for every request within
    a single client session to have a unique
    request id, although request ids may
    be reused - provided that the previous
    request with the same id is no longer
    active (that is, the client already
    got a response).

The rest of request parameters are
request type-specific, and are described below.

All responses will be an array
of at least two elements.  The **first
element** will be the request type ORed
with either 0x10 to indicate a successfull
reply, or with 0x20 to indicate an error.
The **second element** will be the **request id**.
In case of an error, the third, and last,
element will be a textual description
of the error.  In case of a successfull
reply, the rest of response array
elements are request type-specific,
and are described below.

## SETOPT

The **SETOPT** request allows the client
to change several per-destination
and per-destination/client options.

Please note that setting values for options that are specific
for a destination, and not for a destination/client
session, will affect other clients
making requests towards the same destination.

SETOPT parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

parameter 4
:   a map of options

The map of options may contain any
number of supported options, including zero,
in which case SETOPT is exactly equivalent
to GETOPT.

Supported options:

**`version`**
:   SNMP version, 1 for SNMP 1, 2 for SNMP 2c, 3 for SNMP 3;  default is **2**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`community`**
:   SNMP community;  default is **"public"**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`engineid`**
:   Authoritative SNMP engine ID of the destination (for SNMPv3).  The default is **""**.
    Valid values must be (optionally space-separated) hex strings, for example
    "39 6a 66 39 4d 5a 35 6b 68 49 72 61".
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`username`**
:   User name (for SNMPv3);  default is **""**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`authprotocol`**
:   Authentication protocol (for SNMPv3);  default is **"sha1"**.
    Valid values are "md5" and "sha1" (but "md5" is currently not implemented).
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`authpassword`**
:   Authentication password (for SNMPv3);  default is **""**.
    The `authpassword` is never returned by **GETOPT**
    (instead, `authkul` is computed and returned).
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`authkul`**
:   Localized authentication key (for SNMPv3);  default is **""**.
    Valid values must be (optionally space-separated) hex strings.
    It is an error to specify both `authpassword` and `authkul`.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`privprotocol`**
:   Privacy protocol (for SNMPv3);  default is **"aes"**.
    Valid values are "des", "aes", "aes192", "aes256", and "aes256c".
    Only "aes" and "aes256c" are currently implemented.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`privpassword`**
:   Privacy password (for SNMPv3);  default is **""**.
    The `privpassword` is never returned by **GETOPT**
    (instead, `privkul` is computed and returned).
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`privkul`**
:   Localized privacy key (for SNMPv3);  default is **""**.
    Valid values must be (optionally space-separated) hex strings.
    It is an error to specify both `privpassword` and `privkul`.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`global_max_packets`**
:   Maximum global number of SNMP packets being "on the wire"
    at any given time.
    This is a **global** option which affects all destinations
    and all clients.
    See also `max_packets_on_the_wire` statistic for the **INFO**
    request.

**`max_packets`**
:   Maximum number of SNMP packets to the destination being "on the wire"
    at any given time.  The `snmp-query-engine` will avoid sending
    any new SNMP requests exceeding this number
    until getting a reply or a timeout.  The default is **3**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_req_size`**
:   Maximum SNMP request packet size in bytes,
    not counting IP and UDP headers.  Any request
    which would exceed this size will be split
    into smaller pieces.  Conversely, if there
    are pending several small requests from the same
    client towards the same destination, they may
    be combined into a single SNMP request.
    The default is **1400**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_reply_size`**
:   Maximum SNMP reply packet size in bytes,
    not counting IP and UDP headers.
    When composing a request, the query engine
    estimates the expected size of the reply
    using `estimated_value_size` option.
    If the estimated reply size exceeds
    `max_reply_size`, the request will be
    split into smaller pieces.
    This option is only relevant for `get* requests.
    The default is **1472**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`estimated_value_size`**
:   The expected size of a returned value in bytes.
    The default is **9**, which corresponds to the
    largest possible 64-bit counter.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_oids_per_request`**
:   Never ask for more than this number of oids
    in a single SNMP get query.
    The default is **64**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`timeout`**
:   Time, in milliseconds, after which the SNMP
    request will be re-sent (up to a configurable
    number of retries).  The default is **2000** (which is probably too little).
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`retries`**
:   Number of times a request will be re-sent (including the first
    send), after which a timeout will be returned to the client.
    The default is **3**.
    This is a per destination/client option which does
    not affect other clients.

**`min_interval`**
:   Time, in milliseconds, that must pass between
    subsequent SNMP queries towards the destination.
    The default is **10**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`max_repetitions`**
:   How many OIDs shall the destination return
    in a single reply when requesting a table
    using SNMP 2c.  This can be overridden
    by individual GETTABLE requests.  The default is **10**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`ignore_threshold`**
:   All queries of the destination will immediately
    return with an "ignored" error for `ignore_duration`
    milliseconds if number of "hard timeouts" will
    exceed `ignore_threshold` in a row (without any
    successfull replies between timed out queries).
    If `ignore_threshold` is 0, no queries will be
    ignored.  The default is **0**.
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**`ignore_duration`**
:   See `ignore_threshold` above.
    The default is **300000** milliseconds (5 minutes).
    This is a per destination option which affects other clients.

**SETOPT** reply will consist of a single map
with all current option values
for a given destination and client.

## GETOPT

The **GETOPT** request allows the client
to query per-destination and per-destination/client
options.

GETOPT parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

**GETOPT** reply will consist of a single map
with all current options for a given destination
(see **SETOPT** parameters for options description).

## INFO

The **INFO** request returns global and connection statistics.
It has no extra parameters.

**INFO** reply will consist of a map with two keys, **connection**
and **global**.  The values associated with those keys are
themselves maps with, respectively, connection and global
stats.

## GET

Clients should use the **GET** request
to obtain one or more oids from a destination.
A single **GET** request will correspond
to one or more SNMP gets, depending on the
values of *`max_req_size`*, *`max_reply_size`*,
*`estimated_value_size`*, and *`max_oids_per_request`*
options.

GET parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

parameter 4
:   an array of oids to get

**GET** reply consists of an array, each element
of which corresponds to a single requested oid.
Each such element is itself a two-element array.
The first element will be oid itself.
The second element will either be a value,
or an array with a single element.  If it is
an array, its only element will be an error
description.  Possible errors are:

no-such-object
:   SNMP reply returned "no such object" for this oid

no-such-instance
:   SNMP reply returned "no such instance" for this oid

end-of-mib
:   SNMP reply returned "end-of-mib" for this oid

timeout
:   there was a timeout;  for **GET** requests
    with a small number of oids, in case of timeout
    all oids will generally return this error;
    for larger **GET** requests, it is perfectly
    possible to get this error for only some
    of the oids

ignored
:   the oid was requested during time when its
    destination was in the "ignore" state
    (see `ignore_threshold` and `ignore_duration`
    options for details)

missing
:   the oid not found in the reply

decode-error
:   there was an error decoding the value

unsupported type 0xHH
:   the `snmp-query-engine` does not support
    values of this type (yet)

XXXv3
:   there are SNMPv3-related errors

Example request:

    [GET, $id, "127.0.0.1", 161,
       [ "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0",
         "1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0",
         "1.3.66" ]
    ]

Example reply:

    [GET|0x10, $id, [
       ["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0", "my.host.name"],
       ["1.3.6.1.2.1.25.1.1.0", 215485727],
       ["1.3.66", ["no-such-object"]],
     ],
    ]

## GETTABLE

Clients should use the **GETTABLE** request
to obtain a table of oids from a destination.
A single **GETTABLE** request will correspond
to one or more SNMP get-next (for SNMP version 1)
or get-bulk (for SNMP version 2) queries.

GETTABLE parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

parameter 4
:   an oid of a table to get

**GETTABLE** reply consists of an array, each element
of which corresponds to a single oid from the requested table.
Each such element is itself a two-element array.
The first element will be oid itself.
The second element will either be a value,
or an array with a single element.  If it is
an array, its only element will be an error
description.  Possible errors are the same as in **GET**
request, plus the following error specific to **GETTABLE**:

non-increasing
:   this oid is less than or equal than the
    previous oid in the table;  there will be
    no further attempts to continue iterating
    the table

The requested table oid is never present in the reply itself
if there were no errors.

Example request 1:

    [GETTABLE, $id, "127.0.0.1", 161, "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5"]

Example reply 1:

    [GETTABLE|0x10, $id, [["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0", "my.host.name"]]]

Example request 2:

    [GETTABLE, $id, "127.0.0.1", 161, "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0"]

Example reply 2 ("empty table"):

    [GETTABLE|0x10, $id, []]

Example request 3:

    [GETTABLE, $id, "1.1.1.1", 161, "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5"]

Example reply 3 ("table oid itself in error reply"):

    [GETTABLE|0x10, 41, [["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5", ["timeout"]]]]

Example request 4:

    [GETTABLE, $id, "ip-of-some-misbehaving-host", 161, "1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5"]

Example reply 4:

    [GETTABLE|0x10, $id, [
      ["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0", "my.host.name"],
      ["1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0", ["non-increasing"]],
    ]]

## DEST INFO

The **DEST INFO** request allows the client
to request per-destination statistics.

DEST INFO parameters:

parameter 2
:   destination IP (v4 only) address in a dot-decimal notation

parameter 3
:   destination port number

**DEST INFO** reply will consist of a map per-destination
statistics.

The following statistics are available:

**`octets_received`**
:   number of payload octets received from the destination

**`octets_sent`**
:   number of payload octets sent to the destination

# SEE ALSO

There is a Perl module which serves as
a client to `snmp-query-engine`,
**Net::SNMP::QueryEngine::AnyEvent**.
It can be found on CPAN
and on github.
